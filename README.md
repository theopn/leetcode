# Leetcode Questions I Have Solved

These are (most of) the Leetcode questions I have solved.
I mainly use C++ and Python.
In fact, I think I exclusively use C++ and Python.

In this README file, you can find key idea and step-by-step instruction on how I approached the questions.
I also included templates for commonly used/important algorithms.
Bolded are ones I thought were interesting and worth revisiting.
Strikethrough are ones I thought were trivial.

In the [Top Interview 150](./top-interview-150) directory, you can see my solutions from 2023 when I attempted to complete [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) problem set (spoilers alert: I failed).
I would trust solutions in this directory more since they are more recent and I hopefully developed a better problem solving skill over time.
